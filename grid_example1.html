            <p>Nature is the foundation of all life on Earth. It provides us with everything we need to survive — clean air, fresh water, nourishing food, and a safe environment to live in. Trees, rivers, mountains, skies, birds, and animals together form the beautiful and delicate balance of nature. Human life is deeply connected to nature, yet modern lifestyles and industrial activities have caused great harm to it. Today, protecting nature is more important than ever before. We must realize that saving nature is the same as saving ourselves. </p>
